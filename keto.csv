🤩 Celebrating 3 years of my hard work! 

And these pictures are a perfect way to reflect on 
. 

My whole journey My account is not only about fitness tips and healthy lifestyle, the main goal here is to show other mamas that pregnancy and having kids is not a verdict for our bodies and attractiveness! Motherhood is tough sometimes, but at the same time it makes us stronger and more resilient. 
Mombod and Imomspirit definitely rock Girl... 

You can do it at home, with minimal equipment, juggling in between household and kids.
All you need is your determination, .self-belief and a concrete goal My journey started with exipure product and cutting out white bread & pastry from my diet. 

Great results take great pains... .and time O!Amazing transformation 💪🤩

Follow❤️ @teaburn_weightloss_review In 2008 researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found something amazing. 

All 59 % that every adult human , old or young , lean or fat , man or woman , always has the same number of fat cells - around 30 billion ! 

Fat cells are like ... balloons - it is not the number of fat cells that increases but the SIZE of your fat cells , they can balloon up to ... FIFTY times their size or more to store fat ! 

Weirdly they also found even if you have gastric band surgery or lipsuction ... your body regains the exact number of fat cells to get back to the pre - set amount ! 

But then in 2021 researchers uncovered a way to actually dissolve fat cells ... A 750 - year old fat - dissolving hack from Vietnam that forces permanent fat cell loss ! 

And is so easy to do and works every time. 

== > Vietnamese Hack Dissolves Fat Cells ( video tutorial ) 224,000 women and men use this hack every day to dissolve pounds of fat as they sleep. 

There is no doubt the billion dollar weight loss industry do not want you to see this video and discover the amazing fat burning secret ! 

Watch it now before the video is taken down III

Ingredients
4 Tbsp unsalted butter, divided
2 Tbsp olive oil, divided
16 oz baby bella mushrooms, thickly sliced
1 small onion, finely diced
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 Tbsp fresh thyme, minced (or 1 tsp dry thyme)
24 oz filet mignon (beef tenderloin) steaks , 6-8 oz each, about 1 1/2"" thick
1/2 cup Merlot wine, or any dry red wine
1 1/2 cups beef broth
1/2 cup whipping cream
1 1/4 tsp sea salt, we use sea salt, divided
1/2 tsp black pepper, divided

Instructions
How to Cook Filet Mignon Recipe:
Place a large heavy-bottomed pan over med/high heat and melt in 2 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp oil. Add sliced mushrooms and cook 6 min or until softened and most of the liquid has evaporated. Add diced onion and cook 3 min, stirring often.
Add minced garlic, 1 Tbsp thyme, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp black pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, 2 min or until garlic is fragrant. Transfer mushrooms to a large plate. Wipe pan clean with a wet paper towel.

Season steaks all over with 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Place the same pan over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp oil. When the butter is hot and finished foaming, add seasoned steaks and sear 3-5 min per side for medium-rare (5-6 min for medium doneness*), turning once.

I’ve been sitting on these photos for 473 days waiting for this moment.

Everyone always asks how…

Listen - there are so many ways people can successfully lose weight, but your MINDSET is going to determine whether you actually do it…

👉🏻I KNEW this day would come. It wasn’t a matter of if, but when. I knew I’d have set backs but failure or quitting wasn’t even an option. There was definitely bumpy roads but there was no “falling off the wagon” and accepting defeat.

👉🏻I wasn’t expecting it to be easy. In fact, I was expecting the exact opposite. It was really hard working out at 233.4 pounds, it was hard choosing veggies over fast food…but it was only hard in the beginning. As I started losing weight I felt so good and wanted to keep going. And now I even crave veggies and hate missing a workout because it’s therapy for me.

👉🏻I didn’t rely on motivation to keep me going. In fact I could count on one hand the days I felt motivated in the past 1.5 years. I became really disciplined and found the most joy in overcoming the hard and proving to myself what I was capable of.

If you want something different, you need to do something different…and maybe that different is stop giving up!

Ingredients
1 pound wild caught large shrimp with shells
4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil , divided
4 cloves garlic , pressed or minced
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
4 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup white wine or chicken stock
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice , or 1/2 lemon
1 tablespoon minced parsley

Instructions
Thaw the shrimp in cool water and remove the shells then devein the shrimp. Discard the shells, rinse and drain the shrimp then transfer to a small bowl. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, half of the garlic, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and the red pepper flakes. Toss to coat and set let sit for 20 minutes for flavors to build.
In a large skillet, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add the shrimp and garlic mixture to the skillet, spacing evenly in the pan. Cook for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes then flip the shrimps over when they begin to become opaque. Cook for 1 more minute or so, watching so the shrimp turn golden but don't brown too much and the garlic doesn't burn. Transfer the shrimp to a small bowl or plate. If you have browned bits of garlic, move the skillet from the heat and remove the browned garlic as it will be bitter.

Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in the skillet over medium heat and add the remaining garlic. Cook for 30 seconds or until fragrant then stir in the white wine and lemon juice. Cook for 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens and reduces by half, stirring occasionally.",1,3,41484617149

Jalapeño Cheese Chips by @ketosnackz 😋
-
3 slices of cheese (I used Colby jack, you could also use shredded, just make each chip about 1 tbsp) 
Sliced Jalepenos
-
1. Preheat oven to 350F. Cut cheese into 4 pieces each (12 total)
2. Place on parchment lined baking sheet, top with jalapeños, bake 7 minutes or until edges turn light brown. .
.
You could switch to broil and leave in for 2 more until edges turn dark brown, if you want a super crunchy / slightly burnt vibe like mine lol.

After the busy day we had packing and rearranging and moving things around in our home for hours… it was much needed to do an easy dinner. Plus I did all that physical work (read: sweat through my clothes in the death heat of Florida summer which in fact begins around Valentine’s Day!!) while still fasting and drinking my ketones and water to keep hydrated and energized!

Tender, juicy, flavorful pork in just 40 minutes making it great for weeknights. There is no added sugar or sweetener at all and it doesn’t need it! You could definitely add some barbecue sauce, but it’s not necessary. Put it on a potato, sweet potato, or make a salad with it. It’s gluten free, dairy free, and low FODMAP. Ingredients listed below and clickable link to the recipe is in my profile.
Ingredients:
Pork butt or loin (butt is more tender)
Garlic oil
Smoked paprika
Cumin
Oregano
Salt and pepper

➡️ KETO PROTEINS ⬅️

Proteins should come from fatty sources, for most of the time (80%), such as eggs, bacon, pork, steak, ground beef and lamb. The remaining 20% should be coming from cheese, chicken, nuts and fish.

I was ready to eat my door knob when I got home. But, I managed to feast tonight, and STILL be Keto!!! I put on my new addiction, Stanley Tucci's Searching for Italy (how does he stay so skinny!!!), cooked up some FiberGourmet low carb high fiber pasta, and sautéed Branzino (thank you  Trader Joe's) in garlic, olive oil, butter, wine and lemon. OMG, this experiment went really well. Served here with a bit of red pepper flakes over everything for a little kick. But... here's the big kick. This whole dinner is under 300 calories and 15net carbs.  Ta dah!!!! 
ps: for the snobs.. Yes I drink red wine with EVERYTHING, including fish. I pretty much only like white wine in cooking, as I did here 😆

Pss:  my late best buddy Don turned me on to the delight of cloth napkins at home. Not only will you save a ton on napkins and paper towels, you're helping save the planet.

Dinner tonight was amazing. 

Used another recipe from a new TikTok creator I just found. It was really easy and packed with so much flavor. 

I did make my own keto bread crumbs using a few slices of keto bread, toasted and puréed in my food processor with a little Parmesan cheese. 

She had hers with some veggies and I wanted some zoodles.

Followed her recipes other than that to a T 👌🏼

66,2022-05-30_03-13-04_UTC,"INFLAMMATION stops weight loss. ❌

If you’ve hit a plateau, and can’t seem to lose another pound, you need to check inflammation.

These are just a few of the classic signs of inflammation.

- Weight Gain
- Joint Pain
- Fatigue
- Sick Often
- Skin Issues
- GI Distress
- Weakness 
- Brain Fog 
- Watery Eyes
- Runny Nose
- Coughing & Phlegm
- Bleeding Gums
- Depression

Insulin and inflammation are the two biggest reasons for obesity and chronic disease.

They go hand-in-hand, and they need to be addressed together.

Is inflammation holding you back from losing weight?

This is a repost of when I made these last Valentines Day. Since then, I even bought some foil wrappers to wrap them individually. (I used squares of tinfoil in the pic)

These are a MUCH healthier version than the store bought ones! 

If you have access to a Costco, hazelnuts (all nuts) are much cheaper here than anywhere else I’ve found.

109,2022-05-30_03-29-21_UTC,"Verena Kalis Probiotic is a dietary supplement in powder form. There is an important component as probiotic Bifidobacterium breve M-16V for more than 2.5 billion. It has the properties of enhancing intestinal function by reducing the number of bad bacteria, restoring the balance of beneficial bacteria, and activating the function of the immune system. From the results of research on infants, it was found that this strain can reduce inflammation in the intestines, significantly reduce allergy symptoms, promote the digestive system and excretory system to be better, and prevent constipation and diarrhea at the same time.

It also contains galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) as a prebiotic with components similar to breast milk. It helps stimulate the function and promotes the growth of microorganisms, and balances out the intestines for a better excretory system. It also contains Inulin which is a dietary fiber that the body cannot digest and does not give energy but is digested by the intestinal microflora which helps reduce the absorption of sugar and reduces the absorption of fats in the body. In addition, it is supplemented with natural extracts from Moro Red Orange that helps burn out fats accumulated in the body, promoting the body shape to be firming and reducing body shape. Also, Garcinia Cambogia Extract with Hydroxycitric Acid helps inhibit the conversion of carbohydrates to fats and stimulates the extraction of fats accumulated in the body to be used as energy.

Benefits:

Helps balance out the intestines
Helps stimulate the function of the immune system
Helps improve the digestive system and excretory system
Helps enhance intestinal function by reducing the number of bad bacteria and restoring the balance of beneficial bacteria

INGREDIENTS🍗

4 Skinless boneless chicken breasts about 1 1/2 lb.

1 Tsp Italian seasoning mix

1 Tsp Garlic Powder

1 Tsp Smoked Paprika

Sea salt and pepper

12 Asparagus stalks end trimmed

1 oz Sun-dried Tomatoes chopped

4 slices Mozzarella Cheese

1 Tbsp Olive Oil

INSTRUCTIONS🥗

Preheat your oven to 400 F.

Place the chicken on a clean chopping board and sprinkle with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.

Start cutting each one lengthwise to create the pockets. Be careful not to cut all the way through.

Add 3 sprigs of asparagus and a couple of pieces of sun-dried tomatoes to a mozzarella slice, then roll it to hold them inside. Stuff the chicken breasts with it.

Close the pocket with a toothpick. Heat oil in a large and cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.

Add in the chicken and sear it until nicely golden brown, about 3-5 minutes per side.

Bake the chicken for 15-20 minutes, or until it is cooked through and no longer pink in the inside.

113,2022-05-30_03-32-15_UTC,"I started out making an omelette, but didn’t have a clean spatula, so it ended up being a scrambled with the largest, softest, most luxurious and buttery curds. With lots of 4 blend cheese, and ground beef. Getting some protein leveraging in. Thinking about getting a longer fast in. 

The raffle is morphing, yet again. I talked to @mcglaun_designs and we’re gonna try to do something really special for you guys. Everyone that put in for it already, will either be grandfathered in, or, if you prefer, your money back. But I’m also going to hook you guys up with some extra shit, because you deserve it.,

The funny thing, even in the worst of that flare up, I never wanted to die. My eyes never lingered on a gun. I didn’t even think about not thinking about it. I realized I was drinking a little too much wine snd throttled it back. Easing back into exercise, gentle stretching, breath work. Trying to figure out budget and time management shy factoring in writing/ starting a business/ if I have a day job. I did once have to remind myself that it wasn’t God who hated me, but the federal government. I’m so glad to fully be myself again. Marijuana, shrooms, exercise, intermittent fasting, meditation and prayer. These things saved my life. All I ever needed to do was dull the pain. 

Be beautiful but dangerous balls of light and love my dudes.

114,2022-05-30_03-32-27_UTC,"✨Treats like cinnamon rolls are usually associated with cheat days, but these sugar-free cinnamon rolls are keto-friendly. Making these keto cinnamon rolls follows a similar process as making regular cinnamon rolls, though with the gluten-free flour there is no need to chill the dough before baking. Many low carb cinnamon roll recipes use almond flour or even crushed macadamia nuts in the dough, but we find coconut flour creates the best consistency and gentle sweetness. .⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨Directions: Preheat the oven to 375°F degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the shredded mozzarella and cream cheese in a microwave safe bowl and melt for 2 minutes. Add remaining dough ingredients and knead until well incorporated. Place the dough onto the baking sheet and top with another piece of parchment paper. Roll dough out until about 1/2"" thick. Melt the butter and mix in the stevia and cinnamon. Spread the mixture onto dough. Cut dough into 6 equal pieces and roll up and twist around into a cinnamon roll shape. Bake until golden brown (approximately 15-18 minutes). Blend all frosting ingredients until smooth. Remove rolls from oven and spread frosting on top. Enjoy your delicious keto cinnamon rolls alone or with a nice glass of heavy cream or almond milk on the side. .
