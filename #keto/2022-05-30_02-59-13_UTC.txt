These RealGoodFood bacon wrapped cheese stuffed chicken breasts are just the easiest dinner. My ninja air fryer did the hard work (much quicker than the oven!) and the fresh green beans I cooked last night were reheated. 

After the busy day we had packing and rearranging and moving things around in our home for hours… it was much needed to do an easy dinner. Plus I did all that physical work (read: sweat through my clothes in the death heat of Florida summer which in fact begins around Valentine’s Day!!) while still fasting and drinking my ketones and water to keep hydrated and energized!
