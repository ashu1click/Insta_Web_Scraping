100 FREAKING POUNDS!!! 🥳🥳🥳

I’ve been sitting on these photos for 473 days waiting for this moment.

Everyone always asks how…

Listen - there are so many ways people can successfully lose weight, but your MINDSET is going to determine whether you actually do it…

👉🏻I KNEW this day would come. It wasn’t a matter of if, but when. I knew I’d have set backs but failure or quitting wasn’t even an option. There was definitely bumpy roads but there was no “falling off the wagon” and accepting defeat.

👉🏻I wasn’t expecting it to be easy. In fact, I was expecting the exact opposite. It was really hard working out at 233.4 pounds, it was hard choosing veggies over fast food…but it was only hard in the beginning. As I started losing weight I felt so good and wanted to keep going. And now I even crave veggies and hate missing a workout because it’s therapy for me.

👉🏻I didn’t rely on motivation to keep me going. In fact I could count on one hand the days I felt motivated in the past 1.5 years. I became really disciplined and found the most joy in overcoming the hard and proving to myself what I was capable of.

If you want something different, you need to do something different…and maybe that different is stop giving up!
