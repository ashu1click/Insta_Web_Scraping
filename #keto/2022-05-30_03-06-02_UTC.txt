After traveling almost 6 hours to and from Jersey to see mom today (for just a couple of hours), and only one Atkins lemon bar in my belly... I was ready to eat my door knob when I got home. But, I managed to feast tonight, and STILL be Keto!!! I put on my new addiction, Stanley Tucci's Searching for Italy (how does he stay so skinny!!!), cooked up some FiberGourmet low carb high fiber pasta, and sautÃ©ed Branzino (thank you  Trader Joe's) in garlic, olive oil, butter, wine and lemon. OMG, this experiment went really well. Served here with a bit of red pepper flakes over everything for a little kick. But... here's the big kick. This whole dinner is under 300 calories and 15net carbs.  Ta dah!!!! 
ps: for the snobs.. Yes I drink red wine with EVERYTHING, including fish. I pretty much only like white wine in cooking, as I did here ðŸ˜†

Pss:  my late best buddy Don turned me on to the delight of cloth napkins at home. Not only will you save a ton on napkins and paper towels, you're helping save the planet. Plus... ya kinda feel a bit special when you treat yourself as a nice restaurant would treat you! As #JuliaChilds would say, "Bon appÃ©tit." @stanleytucci @fibergourmet @traderjoes #keto #ketodiet ðŸŒ¹
