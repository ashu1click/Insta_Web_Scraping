Jalapeño Cheese Chips by @ketosnackz 😋
-
3 slices of cheese (I used Colby jack, you could also use shredded, just make each chip about 1 tbsp) 
Sliced Jalepenos
-
1. Preheat oven to 350F. Cut cheese into 4 pieces each (12 total)
2. Place on parchment lined baking sheet, top with jalapeños, bake 7 minutes or until edges turn light brown. .
.
You could switch to broil and leave in for 2 more until edges turn dark brown, if you want a super crunchy / slightly burnt vibe like mine lol.
