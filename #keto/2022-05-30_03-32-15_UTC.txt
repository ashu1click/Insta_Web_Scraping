I started out making an omelette, but didn’t have a clean spatula, so it ended up being a scrambled with the largest, softest, most luxurious and buttery curds. With lots of 4 blend cheese, and ground beef. Getting some protein leveraging in. Thinking about getting a longer fast in. 

The raffle is morphing, yet again. I talked to @mcglaun_designs and we’re gonna try to do something really special for you guys. Everyone that put in for it already, will either be grandfathered in, or, if you prefer, your money back. But I’m also going to hook you guys up with some extra shit, because you deserve it.,

The funny thing, even in the worst of that flare up, I never wanted to die. My eyes never lingered on a gun. I didn’t even think about not thinking about it. I realized I was drinking a little too much wine snd throttled it back. Easing back into exercise, gentle stretching, breath work. Trying to figure out budget and time management shy factoring in writing/ starting a business/ if I have a day job. I did once have to remind myself that it wasn’t God who hated me, but the federal government. I’m so glad to fully be myself again. Marijuana, shrooms, exercise, intermittent fasting, meditation and prayer. These things saved my life. All I ever needed to do was dull the pain. 

Be beautiful but dangerous balls of light and love my dudes.
