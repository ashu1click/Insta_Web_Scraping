Who's that chubby mama on the left ? 

🤩 Celebrating 3 years of my hard work! 

And these pictures are a perfect way to reflect on 
. 

My whole journey My account is not only about fitness tips and healthy lifestyle, the main goal here is to show other mamas that pregnancy and having kids is not a verdict for our bodies and attractiveness! Motherhood is tough sometimes, but at the same time it makes us stronger and more resilient. 
Mombod and Imomspirit definitely rock Girl... 

You can do it at home, with minimal equipment, juggling in between household and kids.
All you need is your determination, .self-belief and a concrete goal My journey started with exipure product and cutting out white bread & pastry from my diet. 

Great results take great pains... .and time O!Amazing transformation 💪🤩
