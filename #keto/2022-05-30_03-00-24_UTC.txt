On the menu this week. This Paleo Whole30 Pulled Pork made in the Instant Pot is a game changer. Tender, juicy, flavorful pork in just 40 minutes making it great for weeknights. There is no added sugar or sweetener at all and it doesn’t need it! You could definitely add some barbecue sauce, but it’s not necessary. Put it on a potato, sweet potato, or make a salad with it. It’s gluten free, dairy free, and low FODMAP. Ingredients listed below and clickable link to the recipe is in my profile.
Ingredients:
Pork butt or loin (butt is more tender)
Garlic oil
Smoked paprika
Cumin
Oregano
Salt and pepper
Cayenne
