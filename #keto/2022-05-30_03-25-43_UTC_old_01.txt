Happy Sunday! This morning I got up early and went to serve in the infant department of my church. After church I went to Panera and had a free salad to redeem (yay!). I got the Green Goddess salad, which is one of my favorites. This evening I went and played pickleball for a few hours then came home and made some eggs, keto toast, pan fried salami, cheese, and fresh tomatoes. I was hungry after playing so hard! Tomorrow Iâ€™m hoping to go to the pool for the first time this year! #keto #caseydoesketo #ketodiet #ketomeals #ketolifestyle #ketoliving
