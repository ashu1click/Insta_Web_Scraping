Homemade Ferrero Rocher 

This is a repost of when I made these last Valentines Day. Since then, I even bought some foil wrappers to wrap them individually. (I used squares of tinfoil in the pic)

These are a MUCH healthier version than the store bought ones! 

If you have access to a Costco, hazelnuts (all nuts) are much cheaper here than anywhere else I’ve found. 

✨ The name on the posts is @lectinfreelife bc this was my name here until December. Someone has since taken this name. This IS NOT me.
