âœ¨Treats like cinnamon rolls are usually associated with cheat days, but these sugar-free cinnamon rolls are keto-friendly. Making these keto cinnamon rolls follows a similar process as making regular cinnamon rolls, though with the gluten-free flour there is no need to chill the dough before baking. Many low carb cinnamon roll recipes use almond flour or even crushed macadamia nuts in the dough, but we find coconut flour creates the best consistency and gentle sweetness. .â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € âœ¨Directions: Preheat the oven to 375Â°F degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the shredded mozzarella and cream cheese in a microwave safe bowl and melt for 2 minutes. Add remaining dough ingredients and knead until well incorporated. Place the dough onto the baking sheet and top with another piece of parchment paper. Roll dough out until about 1/2" thick. Melt the butter and mix in the stevia and cinnamon. Spread the mixture onto dough. Cut dough into 6 equal pieces and roll up and twist around into a cinnamon roll shape. Bake until golden brown (approximately 15-18 minutes). Blend all frosting ingredients until smooth. Remove rolls from oven and spread frosting on top. Enjoy your delicious keto cinnamon rolls alone or with a nice glass of heavy cream or almond milk on the side. .
