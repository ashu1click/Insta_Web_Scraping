🐓🍝🧀 

Dinner tonight was amazing. 

Used another recipe from a new TikTok creator I just found. It was really easy and packed with so much flavor. 

I did make my own keto bread crumbs using a few slices of keto bread, toasted and puréed in my food processor with a little Parmesan cheese. 

She had hers with some veggies and I wanted some zoodles.

Followed her recipes other than that to a T 👌🏼
