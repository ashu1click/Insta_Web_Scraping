Tonight I wrapped up 56 weeks of @ketogains  #weightlifting #workouts and lifestyles missing only 1 scheduled workout day that entire time. Iâ€™d already been strict #keto since May 2018, but #weighttraining has been so good for continued fat loss, building muscle, and improving my week #T1D immune system. This #diabadass is #kickingdiabetesbutt.
